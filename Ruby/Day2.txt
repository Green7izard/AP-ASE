Thus, Controller deals with a basic question in OO design: How to connect the UI layer to the
application logic layer? Should the Board be the first object to receive the playGame message
from the UI layer? Or something else?
In some OOA/D methods, the name controller was given to the application logic object that
received and "controlled" (coordinated) handling the request.
The Controller pattern offers the following advice:
Name: Controller
Problem: What first object beyond the UI layer receives and coordinates ("controls") a
system operation?
Solution:
(advice)
Assign the responsibility to an object representing one of these choices:
Represents the overall "system," a "root object," a device that the
software is running within, or a major subsystem (these are all
variations of a facade controller).
Represents a use case scenario within which the system operation
occurs (a use case or session controller)
